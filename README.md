assembler written in prolog

So.. I needed to write an assembler for a very small assembly language for a 16 bit machine. And I figured, why not do it in prolog?

Except I have never written prolog before and I had very little idea about it, beyond that it was an interesting language.

To run, I used swipl.

`swipl parser.pl`

then you can run it against the test assembly file

`-? main("Add")`.
